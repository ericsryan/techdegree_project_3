Techdegree Project 3-Work Log
_____________________________

Introduction

This program was developed to implement skills that were learned for using the datetime module, csv reading and writing, and for utilizing REGEX. This program will allow a user to enter work logs into a csv database and search them using various methods.


Installation

Once the techdegree_project_3 folder has been downloaded, the main program can be run in the terminal or console. The main program file is work_log.py


Using the Program

The user has the option to add a new entry, search existing entries, or quit the program. If the user would like to add a new entry they will supply a date, title, time spent, and optional notes for their log. The user is able to search existing logs by date, setting a date range, search term, or REGEX pattern. The user may delete or edit a log from the log view screen.
